# vrncore
archive of the plugin I made for my server. This plugin is no longer maintained. 
You are free to clone it, modify it, or build it yourself. 
This version is compatible with bukkit/spigot/paper 1.12.2.

If you do use it just know that there is a bug with shift clicking items into inventories putting errors in the console.
(It's a very easy fix, just remove the shift click check in GUIgive.java)

If you want a version that is actively maintained and has more features, check out VRNCore Reloaded.
